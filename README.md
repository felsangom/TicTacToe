## TicTacToe

This is my TicTacToe implementation in React with typescript and MinMax algorithm.
Algorithm idea from [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimax-algorithm-in-game-theory-set-3-tic-tac-toe-ai-finding-optimal-move/).

## Requirements

This little app was made using:
* NodeJS v16.16.0
* React v18.2.0

## How to use

1. Clone the project

```
git clone https://github.com/felsangom/TicTacToe.git
```

2. Install dependencies

```
cd TicTacToe
npm install
```

3. Run it

```
npm start
```

It should open the app on your default browser. If it doesn't happen, open http://localhost:3000.
